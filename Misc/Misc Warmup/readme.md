So starting the Misc challenge for warmup we were given a wav file? Interesting audio.

Listening to the audio for 2 seconds normal people will already realise that this is morse code.

Luckily we have morse code decoders online where we can give it an audio to translate.

We got the text

```
K 0 D 3 M 0 R S 3 G 3 M 1 N K
```

and we solved the challenge!
